### Accessibility Features & Testing Results

The application implements comprehensive accessibility features that ensure compatibility with assistive technologies and user preferences. Screen reader support includes proper labeling and hints for all interactive elements, allowing VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android to provide clear audio guidance to users. Dynamic font scaling respects system accessibility settings, automatically adjusting text sizes up to 200% larger while maintaining layout integrity and readability across all interface elements.

Haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation for user interactions, with distinct vibration patterns differentiating between button presses, successful actions, and error states. Cross-platform testing confirms consistent behavior on both iOS and Android devices, with all animations maintaining smooth 60 FPS performance and proper keyboard avoidance functionality. The implementation successfully passes accessibility audits with full compliance for users requiring larger text, screen readers, or alternative input methods.
